# PRASHASTI_SATPATHI_PROFESSIONAL_RESUME
Hi, I am Prashasti. Pre-Final year Computer Science and Engineering student with a specialization in Health Informatics at Vellore Institute of Technology, Bhopal. I am passionate about leveraging cutting-edge technology to solve complex problems and extract meaningful insights from data, with a keen interest in improving healthcare outcomes through informatics.

My academic focus and project-driven learning have equipped me with a strong foundation in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Data Science. I am proficient in building and deploying models and am equally passionate about the infrastructure that powers them, with growing skills in DevOps practices. I am adept at implementing robust solutions using Java and have a solid grasp of Data Structures and Algorithms for efficient problem-solving.
